# Felijity

Felijity is a very easy, lightweight static website builder for blazing fast static websites.  

This is a very preliminar/preview version, build instruction will come in a few days.

## Key points

 * CLI: command line based 
 * easy: just run 'felijity help' and the list of available commands is presented
 * auto-reload: just run 'felijity serve' and you don't even need to hit refresh in the browser everytime you change a file  
 * many websites: with just one project and one 'felijity serve' you can create, manage and update many websites at the same time. 
 * ... many many more to follow...

## How to run 

* Download the most recent release.
* unzip in a folder of your choice, let's assume in <felijity-install-dir> 
* go in a folder under which you want to create a new project (every project can have many websites)
* in Unix-like systems execute:
``` 
  <felijity-install-dir>/felijity.sh new project all-my-sites
```
  
* in Windows systems execute:   
``` 
  <felijity-install-dir>\felijity new project all-my-sites
```
